        </p>
        <h2>How to make?</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil,
                and
                bananas in a second bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
                griddle,
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook until pancakes are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Mix</b>: Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your
                wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to
                the
                bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly
                lumpy.</li>
            <li><b>Cook</b>:Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high
                heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side
                is
                golden brown).</li>
            <li><b>Serve</b>: Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your
                favorite pancake toppings.</li>
        </ol>
